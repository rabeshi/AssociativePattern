## Associative Pattern Mining
Market Basket Analysis is a technique which identifies the strength of association between pairs of products purchased together and identify patterns of co-occurrence. A co-occurrence is when two or more things take place together.

Market Basket Analysis creates If-Then scenario rules, for example, if item A is purchased then item B is likely to be purchased. The rules are probabilistic in nature or, in other words, they are derived from the frequencies of co-occurrence in the observations. Frequency is the proportion of baskets that contain the items of interest. The rules can be used in pricing strategies, product placement, and various types of cross-selling strategies.

### How Market Basket Analysis Works:

In order to make it easier to understand, think of Market Basket Analysis in terms of shopping at a supermarket. Market Basket Analysis takes data at transaction level, which lists all items bought by a customer in a single purchase. The technique determines relationships of what products were purchased with which other product(s). These relationships are then used to build profiles containing If-Then rules of the items purchased.
